# Sports Events Membership Roster Organization

## Description

The Sports Events Membership Roster Organization project is aimed at optimizing the management of sportsmen participating in international-level events organized by XYZ Co Pvt Ltd. With countries nominating athletes from various disciplines, it's crucial to systematize the membership roster, ensuring accurate data representation and generating insightful reports to meet the dynamic needs of event organization.

This project is divided into three stages:

### Stage 1: Data Cleaning

In this stage, the focus is on standardizing the dataset obtained from various sources. This involves tasks such as formatting names, retrieving country names and languages spoken by sportsmen, generating email addresses, and populating sport locations. The data is cleansed and formatted to ensure consistency and accuracy for further analysis.

### Stage 2: Data Analysis

Once the data is cleaned and formatted, the next stage involves analyzing it to extract valuable insights. Using Excel functions and pivot tables, the project aims to summarize data regarding gender distribution, country-wise participation, and other relevant metrics. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the demographics and distribution of sportsmen, aiding in strategic decision-making.

### Stage 3: Generate Report

The final stage focuses on generating actionable reports based on the analyzed data. Utilizing pivot tables, the project generates detailed reports containing essential information such as member IDs, full names, emails, genders, countries, languages, and sports played. The report layout is designed to facilitate easy comprehension and decision-making for event management purposes.
